oai-harvest-manager
===================


OAI Harvest Manager is a simple Java application for managing OAI-PMH
harvesting. It is intended to allow definition of a harvesting
workflow (involving OAI harvesting and subsequent operations like
transformations or mappings of metadata between schemata) in a few
minutes using a configuration file only.

This application uses the OCLC harvester2 library for OAI-PMH requests.
